# SimpleWorkerPool

My solution of problem like this: 
Write thread pool that executes some client tasks. Threads count is set from code. Tasks can be added to this pool from different clients. Tasks are executed for a client in the order in which they were added. Only one task is executed for a client in one moment of time.

This task is from someone's interview, I foud it in RSDN (http://rsdn.ru/forum/job/6077691.1).
